# PKU-Undergraduate_Lecture_Notes

Hi! Welcome to my repository of personal lecture notes from Peking University, Beijing.

While not all notes are perfect, Iâ€™ve posted the ones I believe may be helpful in some way. Whether you're here because you're interested in a field and want a quick overview through these notes, or you're taking a required course and need fast exam prep to free up time for what truly excites you, feel free to use whatever you find useful.

Happy studying!
